## Wallet Account Type

A Wallet Account Type is a classification used to indicate the nature of transactions associated with a wallet. It helps differentiate between different types of wallets based on their primary purpose. There are two main account types:

1. Debit Wallet: A debit wallet is primarily used for saving and accumulating funds.
   - When a transaction occurs in a debit wallet, it is considered an addition (i.e., funds are added to the wallet).
   - Examples of debit wallets include personal savings accounts, emergency funds, and investment accounts.

2. Credit Wallet: A credit wallet is typically associated with loans, credit lines, or borrowed funds.
   - When a transaction occurs in a credit wallet, it is considered a reduction (i.e., funds are deducted from the wallet).
   - Examples of credit wallets include credit cards, student loans, and mortgages.

By clearly defining the wallet account type, users can better understand the purpose and expected behavior of their wallets. Whether it's for saving or borrowing, choosing the right account type ensures effective financial management. üòä
